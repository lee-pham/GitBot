>After running the GitBot program for 29 days on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, the tiny computer was retired and given a well needed `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`

Bot designed to exploit the terms of a 30-day git Challenge hosted by UT Austin's [Freetail Hackers](https://freetailhackers.com). The script adds a timestamp to a text file and pushes the update every 12 hours.
